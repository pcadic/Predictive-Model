Generate a predictive model using a dataset about Arbnbb price in Europe found in the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities


Data Exploration : Genertaion oh heatmap and correlation matrix


Data-Preparation: Identify significant features of interest for the models through the assistance of automated feature selection algorightms, such as recursive
feature elimination, forward -feature selection, and feature importance.


Data-Preparation: Create dummy variables


Data Modelling:

• Linear Regression and Cross Fold Validation

• Linear Regression with Scalar and Cross Fold Validation 

• Random Forest

• Stacked model and Cross Fold validation


Model Evaluation: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is computed to evaluate model success over multiple runs. Average RMSE and RMSE standard deviation are retrived at the end.
